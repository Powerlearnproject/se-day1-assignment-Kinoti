Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 (i) The Advent of High-Level Programming Languages (1950s-1960s)
Description:
The development of high-level programming languages such as FORTRAN (1957), COBOL (1959), and ALGOL (1958) marked a significant shift from machine-level and assembly languages.
These languages allowed developers to write code using more human-readable syntax, which greatly improved productivity and reduced the likelihood of errors.

(ii) The Software Crisis and the Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
Description:
The term "software engineering" was first coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This conference was convened in response to what was termed the "software crisis," 
characterized by projects running over budget, late deliveries, and software that was often unreliable and difficult to maintain.

(iii) The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001)
Description:
The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, marked a paradigm shift in software development. Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), emphasized iterative development,
customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change over rigid planning and documentation.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
(i) Requirements Gathering and Analysis
Description:
This phase involves collecting and analyzing the requirements from stakeholders to understand what the software needs to accomplish.
This includes functional requirements (what the software should do) and non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.).

(ii) Design
Description:
In this phase, the system architecture and design are created based on the requirements gathered. 
This includes both high-level design (system architecture) and low-level design (detailed design of components and modules).

(iii) Implementation (Coding)
Description:
This is the phase where the actual code is written based on the design specifications. 
Developers follow coding standards and best practices to ensure the code is maintainable and scalable.

(iv) Testing
Description:
The testing phase involves verifying that the software works as intended and identifying any defects or issues. 
Various types of testing are conducted, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

(v) Deployment
Description:
Once the software has been thoroughly tested and approved, it is deployed to the production environment where it becomes available to end-users.

(vi) Maintenance
Description:
After deployment, the software enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored and updated as needed. This includes fixing any issues that arise, making improvements, and adding new features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
(a) Waterfall Methodology
The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Each phase of the SDLC (Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintenance) is completed before moving on to the next. It is characterized by detailed documentation and a rigid structure.
